## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Dot shows, but typing doesn't work  
Run the EXE as **Administrator** (keyboard hooks sometimes require it).

### Microphone not working  
Make sure your mic is the Windows **Default Recording Device**.

### CPU is slow  
Use the Settings window (Right-click dot) to switch to a smaller Whisper model (e.g., `tiny`).

### Hotkeys conflict  
You can change hotkeys in Settings (Right-click dot).

## 📝 Notes
- All processing is **local** — no audio is sent to any cloud service  
- The EXE may take a few seconds to load the Whisper model on first launch  
- Safe to use on laptop, desktop, and touchscreen devices
